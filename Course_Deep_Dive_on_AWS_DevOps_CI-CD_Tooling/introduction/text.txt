Hello CloudGurus,
welcome to this introduction the my course on AWS DevOps CI/CD Tooling

S2
Let's make you a real AWS DevOps Guru.

S3
The content of this short video is 
a course overview
a short introduction on CodeCommit
CodeBuild
and 
CodeDeploy and CodePipeline
Finally a shot summary and the big picture

S4
Here is the course overview
The first chapter is about CodeCommit
A version control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that you can use to privately store and 
manage files, such as documents, source code, and binary files in the cloud

The second chapter covers CodeBuild, which is a
A fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, 
and produces software packages that are ready to deploy

and in the next chapter we going to cover both CodeBuild and CodePipeline
CodeBuild is 
a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of 
compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers
and finally CodePipeline, the service to bring them all together.
a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines 
for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates

S5
One sentence on each service we going to cover in it's own chapter, starting with
CodeCommit
With CodeCommit you canstore and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files) 
in a private GIT based repository on AWS

S6
This is the content of the CodeCommit chapter
Introduction and chapter overview
Create first CodeCommit Repo
Browse files in Repo
Integration with Eclipse and VisualStudio
Triggers and webhooks
Branches
Pull requests
Summary

S7
The next chapter will focus on CodeBuild
CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. 
The build can be maven, gradle, docker or others

S8
the content of this chapter is:
Introduction and chapter overview
Providers
First CodeBuild project
Docker example project
Input sources and output artifacts
Static website example project
Lambda example project
Monitoring codebuild
Env variables
Summary


S9
We will finally talk about CodeDeploy and CodePipeline in the last chapter, focusing on these 2 services
CodeDeploy
deploys your code to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, 
serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.

S10
whereas CodePipeline
models, visualizes, and automates the steps required to release your software

S11
the content of this chapter is :
Introduction and chapter overview
First pipeline with CodeCommit repo
Create ECS deploy pipeline
Create a pipeline with cloud formation
Create android app pipeline
Stages
Cloudwatch events, webhooks and change triggers
Summary

S12
Finally the big picture
We have the 3 AWS services 
CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy which can represent on stage in a CodePipeline ( source , build , deploy)

S13
And this is exactly the idea of CodePipeline which
Manages the complete build pipeline from source over build to deployment
models, visualizes, and automates the steps required to release your software

S14
So far an overview about the course content and now let's get started 
with the first chapter about CodeCommit


















S12
First lesson is a an Introduction and chapter overview

In the first HandsOn lession we Create our first CodeCommit Repo

Then lets have a look on how to Browse files in Repo

In a handsOn lesson lets see how to Integration with Eclipse and VisualStudio

The next lesson will introduce Triggers and webhooks with handsOn examples

Next we gonna have a look on Branches in CodeCommit

And once you know how to create Branches, we going to cover Pull requests

and finally a short Summary of the CodeCommit chapter
